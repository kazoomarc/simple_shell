# SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT
## Implementing basic commands such as:
### ls, cat, echo e.t.c.

## Using basic C programming concepts such as:
### Structures, Pointers, Variadic fxns e.t.c.

## Simple shell should return same output/error messages for commands such as cat, echo e.t.c and also some edge cases except specified otherwise
## This project seeks to give us better understanding of the differences between system calls & functions as well as understanding how processes could be manipulated.
